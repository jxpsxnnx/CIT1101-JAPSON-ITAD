    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; My name is <b>Justin Aaron D. Japson</b>, a 20 year old boy born in San Juan City<sup>1</sup>. I have so many fond memories in this city especially with my friends<sup>2</sup>. If you will ask me where will I go if I have a chance to go back in time? I will choose my childhood years<sup>3</sup>. No worries, no responsibilities, you have time for yourself and all you have to do is to play with your friends until your legs can't run<sup>4</sup>. I grew up without a dad that's why I learned some of my hobbies myself like playing basketball<sup>5</sup>. Growing up without a dad is not that hard for me because I have my mom, she always supports me at everything<sup>6</sup>. Eventhough we're poor she always tries to give me what I want<sup>7</sup>. Being poor really helped me a lot in my present life because I experienced it because I dont want it to happen again<sup>8</sup>. I began studying in Salapan Elementary School, this is one of my happiest years of my life because I gain so many friends since grade 1 - grade 6<sup>9</sup>. I remember playing DOTA with them when our classes is done sometimes we play in their houses but most of the time we just run around and play<sup>10</sup>. 
        I also get scolded not by my parents but also my teachers<sup>11</sup>. During breaktime it's automatic, we will go to the playground sometimes we forgot to eat our lunch because of playing too much<sup>12</sup>. When I was in elementary, Aj,Jasper, and cole are my bestfriends<sup>13</sup>. They are always there for me<sup>14</sup>. They know everything about me; even my secrets<sup>15</sup>. I canâ€™t keep anything from them<sup>16</sup>. They are the persons who help me when I am down, and make me feel better about myself<sup>17</sup>. Without them I would not be as happy as I am now<sup>18</sup>. I graduated elementary in 2014, that hits me because I know my friends and I will not attend in the same school<sup>19</sup>. But I know will still gonna see each other even if we are far away from each other<sup>20</sup>. Right now I still talk to them and we sometimes go out just to talk about what is happening in our lives<sup>21</sup>.

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Going to highschool, I remember getting anxious when I first enrolled in a university because it's my first time going in a popular and large school<sup>1</sup>. My mother's sister is the one who pays for my tuition fee, she really helped us a lot because without her I may not be studying in UE in the first place because we cannot afford the price<sup>2</sup>. When the semester started I can feel my self gettign nervous and my classmates already know everyone because they're all friends when they are in elementary and I was the only transferee in the room<sup>3</sup>. But my sitmate approached me first and we talked about everything about me and him<sup>4</sup>. That sitmate became my bestfriend until now<sup>5</sup>. Time after time I gain so many friends not just in my classroom but also in other sections<sup>6</sup>. We always play in the playground and garden, we play basketball when there are no students in gym<sup>7</sup>. Going to grade 8, I'm still the same person, still immature and just wants to play<sup>8</sup>. My friends and I sometimes cut class just to play basketball or in the computer<sup>9</sup>. My grades don't fail but I can see it's difference from my grade 7 grades<sup>10</sup>. I tried my best to recover my grades, I studied hard but I also give time for myself
        <sup>11</sup>. My friends also joins me to study hard in that semester because their grades are also low<sup>12</sup>. By the end of the semester our names are in the top 10 of the class<sup>13</sup>. We're all so proud of that and we celebrate it. Fast forward to grade 10, this year is the best time of my life the second one is my elementary<sup>14</sup>. I'm always excited to go to school because of my friends, we always laugh and enjoys every second of the day<sup>15</sup>. Even when it's saturday or sunday my friends and I always go out, if we dont have a money we go to our friends house and just eat pancit canton while playing play station or basketball<sup>16</sup>. But just like in grade 6 we always have that time when we need to separate because we have a moving up ceremony<sup>17</sup>. But me and my friends promised to ourselves that we're not gonna forget each other<sup>18</sup>. We're always gonna be brothers and until now were all still the same, no awkwardness or anything<sup>19</sup>. We're friends for 7 years now and we all still want to continue that until we die<sup>20</sup>.

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now it's my college year, Right now I really don't enjoy my college because of the pandemic<sup>1</sup>. I'm not a fan of online class because for me online class is more stressful than the face to face class<sup>2</sup>. I don't enjoy looking at my laptop everymorning, sometimes I feel like I'm watching a youtube tutorial when I listen to some of my professors<sup>3</sup>. But right now I got more used to it, I can listen properly without getting distracted at everything<sup>4</sup>.But Im still not enjoying it and this course is not my first choice<sup>5</sup>. 
        My course is aeronautical engineering that my first choice but my family cannot afford the tuition that's why I don't have a choice but to go to IT<sup>6</sup>. Im not good in programming and that's my only weakness in this course but I'm trying my best to learn it<sup>7</sup>. I also gain some friends eventhough it's online class, I always talked to them if it's connected to our subjects but there are times that I play with them<sup>8</sup>. I want to enjoy my college years because this year will be my last to be an adult<sup>9</sup>. I don't want to finished my adulthood in a computer<sup>10</sup>. 
        That's why I want a face to face class because I can now make friends to new people<sup>11</sup>. I want to enjoy going out again, drinking with my friends, going out of town with them and enjoying life while I'm free to do it<sup>12</sup>. Because when I graduated to college I will not have a time to experience that again because it's already the real world<sup>13</sup>. Things will change because of our jobs, we will have a bigger responsibilities in our life<sup>14</sup>. That's why while I'm at the peak of my adulthood I'll try my best to enjoy every last of it so that I can have no regrets when I became old<sup>15</sup>. I can tell myself that I did what I want and I don't regret anything about it<sup>16</sup>.
